# The Demiurge Grotto

Explore a shapeshifting cave filled with treasures and dangers looking for clues left by your lost leader.

The Demiurge Grotto is a 2D action platformer with some dungeon crawler elements. Players have
to explore several dungeons together in order to find treasures and discover the messages of the
lost teammates (unlockable as playable characters). Every playable character has its own unique
skills that can be used to overcome the dungeon's obstacles and enemies.
A player starts his/her journey with only one character that is randomly selected among the playable
characters. Then he/she will be able to unlock the other three characters during the game by finding
some letters. To complete every dungeon, players will have to cooperate with others each one with
a different character, using the different abilities in order to overcome obstacles.
Since the changing nature of the Demiurge Grotto, dungeons are procedurally generated by
connecting several rooms together. Each room has a typical 2D platformer level design structure.
Treasures can be found in the dungeons and used to power up your characters.
The ultimate goal of the game is to follow the trail of hints left by the leader, in order to save him
and find the greatest treasure of all times hidden in the deepest part of the Demiurge Grotto.
